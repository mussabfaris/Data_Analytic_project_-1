1. Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the key metrics and insights for an electronics retail store. It visualizes the performance of various product categories, sales trends, customer demographics, and profitability. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies, inventory management, and customer engagement.

2. Problem Statement

The electronics store faced challenges in tracking sales trends across various product categories, identifying underperforming regions, and understanding customer purchasing behaviors. Additionally, there was a need for better visibility into inventory levels and profitability to streamline operations and increase efficiency.

3. Objectives

The main objectives of this dashboard are:
•	To track and visualize sales trends across different product categories (e.g., smartphones, laptops, accessories).
•	To analyze customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
•	To monitor inventory levels and ensure stock availability for high-demand products.
•	To provide insights into store profitability and identify areas for cost optimization.
•	To allow managers to track performance by region, product type, and time period.

4. Steps for Development

a. Data Collection
•	Source: Sales data, customer data, inventory data, and financial data were collected from the store's transactional systems.
•	ETL Process: Data was extracted from multiple sources, transformed to remove inconsistencies, and loaded into Power BI for visualization.
b. Data Modeling
•	Data Integration: Different datasets were integrated to create a single unified model that relates sales, customer demographics, and inventory levels.
•	Relationships: Key relationships between tables (e.g., products, sales, customers) were established to enable cross-functional analysis.
c. Visualizations
•	Sales Analysis: Line charts and bar charts show monthly/quarterly/yearly sales trends across product categories.
•	Customer Demographics: Pie charts and stacked bar graphs display customer age groups, gender distribution, and geographic location.
•	Inventory Monitoring: Tables and heatmaps provide real-time insights into stock levels, showing low-stock items that need replenishment.
•	Profitability: KPIs and gauges display gross profit margins, revenue, and cost comparisons by region or store.
•	Regional Performance: Maps allow for geographic analysis of store performance across regions.
d. Filters and Interactions
•	Dynamic filters allow users to drill down into specific time periods, product categories, regions, or customer segments to gain deeper insights.
•	Users can toggle between sales metrics (e.g., revenue, units sold) to see different perspectives on the data.
e. Testing and Validation
•	The dashboard was tested using historical data to ensure accuracy in visualizations and KPI calculations.
•	Feedback from key stakeholders was incorporated to refine the dashboard design and functionality.
f. Deployment
•	The dashboard was published on the Power BI service to enable access by store managers and executives.
•	Permissions were set up to ensure data privacy and access control based on user roles.

5. Key Features
